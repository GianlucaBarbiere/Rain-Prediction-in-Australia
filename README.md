# Introduction
Australia's diverse climate, characterized by varying weather patterns and extreme conditions, makes accurate rainfall prediction crucial for numerous sectors, including agriculture, water resource management, and emergency planning. This data science project focuses on developing predictive models to determine whether it will rain the following day in Australia. We employ five different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DTREE), and Linear Regression.

# Project
The dataset info are detailed described in the project [Rain prediction in Australia](https://github.com/GianlucaBarbiere/Rain-Prediction-in-Australia/blob/main/Rain%20Prediction%20in%20Australia.ipynb)
The primary objectives of this project encompass:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering comprehensive weather data, including historical meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. Data preprocessing involves cleaning, feature engineering, and addressing missing values.

2. Model Selection and Training: Implementing and training five machine learning models—Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, DTREE, and Linear Regression—for binary classification to predict whether it will rain the next day.

3. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of each model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, Log loss and Jaccard-index. For Linear Regression model the metrics used are Mean absolute error, Mean squared error and R2-Score.
This allows for a comprehensive comparison of their predictive abilities.

5. Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential features that contribute to the prediction of rainfall, enabling insights into key weather factors affecting the likelihood of rain.
